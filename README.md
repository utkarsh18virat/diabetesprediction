The Diabetes Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes. This project leverages various machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of diabetes onset. By using historical health data and relevant features, the model can provide valuable insights and early warnings, enabling proactive management of diabetes risk.
